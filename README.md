interface in Java 23rd April

1:- ex : create an interface shape having method declaration for draw method.

2:-In this example, the Drawable interface has

3:-example of java interface which provides the implementation of Bank interface.

4:-ex Multiple inheritance in Java by interface. 

5:- Multiple inheritance is not supported through class in java, but it is possible by an interface, why?

6:-As you can see in the above example, Printable and Showable interface have same methods but its implementation is provided by class TestTnterface1, so there is no ambiguity.A    class implements an interface, but one interface extends another interface.

7:-Java Default Method in Interface.

8:-Java 8 Static Method in Interface.

9:-ex Difference between abstract class and interface .

10:-Example of abstract class and interface in Java Let's see a simple example where we are using interface and abstract class both.

1.Create a class named 'Student' with String variable 'name' and integer variable 'roll_no'. Assign the value
of roll_no as '2' and that of name as "John" by creating an object of the class Student.

2.Assign and print the roll number, phone number and address of two students having names "Sam" and
"John" respectively by creating two objects of class 'Student'.

4.Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5 units by creating
a class named 'Triangle' with constructor having the three sides as its parameters.

5.Write a program to print the area of two rectangles having sides (4,5) and (5,8) respectively by creating a
class named 'Rectangle' with a method named 'Area' which returns the area and length and breadth
passed as parameters to its constructor.

6.Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' having two methods.
First method named as 'setDim' takes length and breadth of rectangle as parameters and the second
method named as 'getArea' returns the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth of rectangle are
entered through keyboard.

7.Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' taking the values of its
length and breadth as parameters of its constructor and having a method named 'returnArea' which
returns the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth of rectangle are entered through keyboard.

8.Print the average of three numbers entered by user by creating a class named 'Average' having a
method to calculate and print the average.

             AccessModifiers  Encapsulation  ObjectClass  object cloning
Private access modifier ex 

example of default modifier

Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.

Private access modifier ex
