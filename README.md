154.Covarientreturntype.java.

155.super is used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.We can use super keyword to access the data member or field of parent class. It is used if parent class
and child class have same fields.

156.:-In the above example, Animal and Dog both classes have a common property color. If we print color
property, it will print the color of current class by default. To access the parent property, we need to use super keyword.

157.:-super can be used to invoke parent class method.

158.Super key word example

159.uper is used to invoke parent class constructor.The super keyword can also be used to invoke the parent class constructor. Let's see a simple example:

160.example of super keyword

161.Another example of super keyword where super() is provided by the compiler implicitly.

162.super example: real used
Let's see the real use of super keyword. Here, Emp class inherits Person class so all the properties of Person will be inherited to Emp by default. To initialize all the property, we are using parent class constructor from child class. In such way, we are reusing the parent class constructor.

163.:-create a parent class account having fields accountno and balance. and constructor with 2 parameters create a subclass saving inherited from account class having fields interest and constructor with 3 parameters and from this call parent class constructor.and a display method, deposit method and withdrawl method.

185:-example of java interface which provides the implementation of Bank interface.

186:-ex Multiple inheritance in Java by interface. 

187:- Multiple inheritance is not supported through class in java, but it is possible by an interface, why?

189:-As you can see in the above example, Printable and Showable interface have same methods but its implementation is provided by class TestTnterface1, so there is no ambiguity.A    class implements an interface, but one interface extends another interface.

190:-Java Default Method in Interface.
